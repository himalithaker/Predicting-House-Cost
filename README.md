# Predicting-House-Cost
Predicting House Price by considering various factors 
 The project is to predict the price of the house by applying liner regression on the dataset and try to get good accuracy. 
 The threshold of accuracy is up to 85%, but for this dataset I tried to get 91% approx accuracy. 
 The dataset that I have used for predicting the house price is kc_house_data.csv in csv format,
 where this file includes all the details that are essential for predicting the price 
 such as id, price, number of bedroom, number of bathroom, sqft_living, sqft_lot,  sqft_basement, date, floor, waterfront, view, year, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15 and many other. 
 Along with that visual.py file is used which has function of model learning and for getting decision tree. 
 
 Moreover, while performing liner regression the accuracy for predicting the house was 73%, which is far from threshold,
 so to achieve atleast 85% I had used Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) in which 91% of accuracy is achieved .
